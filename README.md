  PluralJS

<p  align="center">A micro library to produce any singular noun into plural
  
### 💡 Motive
---
I was curious to learn about how to build a library, what are the thought-processes behind it, what are the technical stuff you need to know etc. This was the primary reason PluralJS came into conception.
